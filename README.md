Quant Insider Market Making Challenge – Submission

#-------PROJECT OVERVIEW-------------

This project implements a Python-based market-making algorithm for the Quant Insider Market Making Challenge. The goal is to simulate a market maker that:
Quotes bid and ask prices dynamically around the mid-price
Adapts to order book imbalance and inventory risk
Tracks PnL and inventory over time
Compares baseline vs adaptive strategies
The project includes a simulator for local testing and optional integration with Nubra’s UAT environment.

#-------STRATEGIES IMPLEMENTED--------
1. Baseline Strategy

Fixed spread around mid-price
Passive quoting (no inventory or imbalance adjustment)
Simple control strategy to serve as a benchmark

2. Adaptive Strategy

Computes mid-price from order book
Measures order book imbalance: the difference between buy and sell volumes at top levels
Implements adaptive inventory skew:

If inventory is positive → bid is lowered, ask is raised
If inventory is negative → bid is raised, ask is lowered

#----NUBRA SDK USAGE---------

While the simulation can run without Nubra, the project is ready to use Nubra’s UAT environment:
Authentication handled via nubra_python_sdk
Optional WebSocket client in data_sources/nubra_ws.py
Fetches real-time market data and order book updates
Can switch between simulator and Nubra live feed using:

USE_NUBRA = True  # in market_maker.py


Note: For competition submission, simulator runs are sufficient. Nubra integration is optional but supported.
Dynamically adjusts bid/ask quotes to manage inventory risk
Aims for higher PnL with controlled inventory drift

#----HOW TO RUN---------

1.Run market making simulation:

python market_maker.py

Runs both baseline and adaptive strategies

2.Generates CSV logs in logs/:

logs/mm_logs_baseline.csv
logs/mm_logs_adaptive.csv


3.Generate plots for comparison:

python plot_results.py

4.Generates comparison plots in plots/:

plots/pnl_comparison.png
plots/inventory_comparison.png

#---LOGS-------

CSV logs include the following columns:

Column	  |Description
timestamp	|Tick timestamp
best_bid	|Best bid in order book
best_ask	|Best ask in order book
mid	      |Mid-price
bid_quote	|Bid quote generated by strategy
ask_quote	|Ask quote generated by strategy
imbalance	|Order book imbalance
inventory	|Current net position
cash	    |Cash balance from fills
pnl	      |Mark-to-market PnL (cash + inventory × mid)

#-----PLOTS-----

1.PnL Comparison
pnl_comparison.png shows Baseline vs Adaptive PnL over time
Adaptive PnL is generally higher and smoother

2.Inventory Comparison
inventory_comparison.png shows Baseline vs Adaptive inventory drift
Adaptive inventory is kept closer to zero, reducing risk

#------OBSERVATIONS------

Baseline Strategy:

Passive quoting
Inventory drifts positive or negative
PnL fluctuates and is generally smaller

Adaptive Strategy:

Adjusts quotes based on imbalance + inventory
Inventory stays around zero
PnL is more consistent and higher on average

This demonstrates that adaptive inventory skew + order book responsiveness improves market-making performance.
