#-------PROJECT OVERVIEW-------------

This project implements a Python-based market-making algorithm for the Quant Insider Market Making Challenge. The goal is to simulate a market maker that:
Quotes bid and ask prices dynamically around the mid-price
Adapts to order book imbalance and inventory risk
Tracks PnL and inventory over time
Compares baseline vs adaptive strategies
The project includes a simulator for local testing and optional integration with Nubra’s UAT environment.
# Quant Insider Market Making Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the **Quant Insider Market Making Challenge**.

The project implements a Python-based market-making algorithm that:
- Consumes order book data (simulated or via Nubra UAT)
- Quotes bid and ask prices around the mid-price
- Manages inventory risk
- Tracks PnL over time
- Compares a baseline strategy with an adaptive strategy

---

## Strategies Implemented

### 1. Baseline Strategy
- Quotes a fixed spread around the mid-price
- No inventory or order book imbalance adjustment
- Serves as a benchmark strategy

### 2. Adaptive Strategy
- Computes mid-price from best bid and ask
- Uses order book imbalance as a signal
- Applies adaptive inventory skew:
  - Positive inventory → less aggressive buying, more aggressive selling
  - Negative inventory → more aggressive buying, less aggressive selling
- Enforces an inventory cap to manage risk

---

## Nubra SDK Usage
The project is designed to work with **Nubra’s UAT environment** using `nubra_python_sdk`.

- Authentication handled via Nubra SDK
- Real-time market data supported through WebSocket logic in `data_sources/nubra_ws.py`
- Strategy can switch between simulator and Nubra feed using:

```python
USE_NUBRA = False  # Set True to use Nubra
```
### HOW TO RUN

1.Run market making simulation:
```python
python market_maker.py
```
Runs both baseline and adaptive strategies

2.Generates CSV logs in logs/:
```python
logs/mm_logs_baseline.csv
logs/mm_logs_adaptive.csv

```
3.Generate plots for comparison:
```python
python plot_results.py
```
4.Generates comparison plots in plots/:
```python
plots/pnl_comparison.png
plots/inventory_comparison.png
```
### LOGS

CSV logs include the following columns:
```python
Column	  |Description
timestamp	|Tick timestamp
best_bid	|Best bid in order book
best_ask	|Best ask in order book
mid	      |Mid-price
bid_quote	|Bid quote generated by strategy
ask_quote	|Ask quote generated by strategy
imbalance	|Order book imbalance
inventory	|Current net position
cash	    |Cash balance from fills
pnl	      |Mark-to-market PnL (cash + inventory × mid)
```
### PLOTS

1.PnL Comparison
pnl_comparison.png shows Baseline vs Adaptive PnL over time
Adaptive PnL is generally higher and smoother

2.Inventory Comparison
inventory_comparison.png shows Baseline vs Adaptive inventory drift
Adaptive inventory is kept closer to zero, reducing risk

### OBSERVATIONS

Baseline Strategy:

Passive quoting
Inventory drifts positive or negative
PnL fluctuates and is generally smaller

Adaptive Strategy:

Adjusts quotes based on imbalance + inventory
Inventory stays around zero
PnL is more consistent and higher on average

This demonstrates that adaptive inventory skew + order book responsiveness improves market-making performance.
